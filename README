== OVERVIEW ==

The ChargeDemo source code demonstrates how to implement 2-way
integration for accepting credit card payments using Credit Card
Terminal for iPhone.

ChargeDemo supplies a single charge button. When it's tapped, a URL
request is made to Credit Card Terminal in order to accept a credit
card payment. When the user is done with Credit Card Terminal,
ChargeDemo will be launched via its URL handler for
com-innerfence-ChargeDemo://.
